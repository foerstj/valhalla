Make Veteran & Elite Great Again!

Veteran should look like the Valhalla of Regular, and Elite should look like the Valhalla of Veteran.

## About
This mod makes the following changes to Veteran & Elite:
- Make enemies bigger
- Add light effects (point-lights & light-rays)

Supported are Vanilla and LoA content, but not Yesterhaven or R2A yet.

## Installation & Compatibility
- This mod is made for LoA, and probably won't work with Vanilla.
- To install, put the dsres file into your DSLOA folder.
- To uninstall, simply remove the file again.
- This mod overwrites the Veteran & Elite templates, and will conflict with other mods that do the same.
